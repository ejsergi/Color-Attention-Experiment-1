%{
In this scrip we will check the total number of fixations done in the
stimuli presented to each hue, in this way we can assume that the stimuli
that a higher number of fixations was done will mean a higher task needed
to be done, therefore less saliency will be find.

Will be interesnting to make a comparison of number of fiations and number
of reported.

Again no significant difference is fund, even though red has a noticible
lower number of fixations.
